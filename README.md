## About The Journey

This "AI Native Journey" repository is dedicated to my hands-on exploration of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and the fundamental coding skills required to build AI-powered applications. It's designed to be a living document of my progress, containing:

* **Mini-Projects:** Small, focused coding exercises or implementations of AI algorithms.
* **Concept Demonstrations:** Code examples illustrating key AI theories (e.g., neural networks, data preprocessing, model evaluation).
* **Learning Resources:** Links to tutorials, articles, and courses that are proving valuable on this path.
* **Reflections:** My notes, challenges encountered, and insights gained during the learning process.

The goal is to build a practical portfolio of skills and projects, documenting the journey from foundational concepts to more advanced AI applications.

### Built With

As this journey progresses, the technologies used will expand. Initial focus includes:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The primary programming language.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - For interactive coding and experimentation.
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - For numerical operations.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data manipulation and analysis.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) / [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - For data visualization.
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) / [Keras](https://keras.io/) - For building and training AI models.
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - For traditional machine learning algorithms.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - For repository hosting and collaboration.
* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - The AI-powered code editor used for development.
